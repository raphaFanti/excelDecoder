Quick python script that transforms the output of BRET analysis machine to excel in graphing friendly format

This python 3 scripts will take as input an excel file with the name "input.xlsx". This is the file generated by the machine [machine name and model] with the testing parameters [testing parameters] and settings [settings here].

For now only configurations using test lines A, B, C and D. However, upon request, it is easy to expand the code to other test slots. Please do let us know if that would be helpful for your research!

For those who know how to run python 3 scripts, this sript requires only "pandas" and "xlrd" packages.

For those new to python, here are a few relevant links:
- Python 3 download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- pandas installation: https://pandas.pydata.org/getting_started.html (I personally don't use Anaconda and install directly with "pip3 install pandas" on Mac)
- xlrd installation via pip: https://pypi.org/project/xlrd/

A tutorial relevant to running this script:
- Runining python scripts from command line: https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/
- Datacamp on running scripts: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/running-a-python-script

For any question, troubleshooting or request to adapt the script please feel free to contact us. Glad to serve the scientific community!
